# BeatSequencer
Making a basic beat sequencer with hopes of learning more about digital audio
workstations and audio in general.

## Systems Requirements
GCC / Linux 

## TODO
1.	Introduce resolution variable which would allow user to place samples in 
	between the counted beats of a bar. *Mostly finished with this, but need
	to work through some bugs.
2.	Add ability to superimpose instruments. Maybe this looks like another sudo-
	enum that tells which samples throughout the beat should be cut before the
	next beat and which should superimpose with the next sample. Or have a user
	defined switch that toggles between allowing or not allowing samples to 
	overlap - wouldn't be very sophisticated but might be a good first step.
