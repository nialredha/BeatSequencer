# Sequencer
Making a basic beat sequencer with hopes of learning more about digital audio
workstations and audio in general.

## Systems Requirements
GC / Linux 

## TODO
1.	Introduce resolution variable which would allow user to place samples in 
	between the counted beats of a bar.
2.	Add error handling when samples inputed have a different number of channels.
3.	Add ability to superimpose instruments. Maybe this looks like another sudo-
	enum that tells which samples throughout the beat should be cut before the
	next beat and which should superimpose with the next sample.
